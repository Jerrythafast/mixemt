Building inputs to `mixemt`:
====================================
This directory contains input files for `mixemt` made from the [Phylotree]
(http://www.phylotree.org/) mitochondrial phylogeny builds. These files were 
generated by taking the full mtDNA tree build files (HTML) and reformatting
them to make them easier to process.

1. Download mtDNA tree Build 17
   [http://www.phylotree.org/builds/mtDNA_tree_Build_16.zip]
   
   or

   [http://www.phylotree.org/builds/mtDNA_tree_Build_17.zip]

2. Extract mtDNA tree build (`.htm`) from the zip file.

3. Convert to `.csv` using MS Excel. Remove unprintable leading characters.

4. Fix newlines, remove empty rows, and remove header entries to produce
  `mixemt` input.

   ```
   tr '\r' '\n' < mtDNA_tree_Build_16.csv \
   | grep -v '^,,*$' \
   | tail -n +16 \
   > mtDNA_tree_Build_16.cleaner.csv
   ```
