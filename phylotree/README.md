Building inputs to `mixemt`:
====================================
This directory contains input files for `mixemt` made from the [Phylotree]
(http://www.phylotree.org/) mitochondrial phylogeny builds. These files were 
generated by taking the full mtDNA tree build files (`HTML`) and reformatting
them to make them easier to process.

1. Download mtDNA tree Build
   
   [http://www.phylotree.org/builds/mtDNA_tree_Build_17.zip]

2. Extract mtDNA tree build (`.htm`) from the zip file.

3. Convert to `.csv` using MS Excel. Remove unprintable leading characters.

4. Fix newlines, remove empty rows, and remove header entries to produce
  `mixemt` input, a comma-separated table that describes the hierarchical tree
  structure.


   ```
   tr '\r' '\n' < mtDNA_tree_Build_17.xls.csv \
   | grep -v '^,,*$' \
   | tail -n +16 \
   > mtDNA_tree_Build_17.csv
   ```
